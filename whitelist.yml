# Whitelist file to filter out some of the differences detected by the checks.
# Each check has its own section, keyed by the check name.
# Each section can have multiple rules.
# Each rule defines a predicate in disjunctive normal form where the innermost
#   conditions are simple equality checks on particular values for fields in the check output.
# Each rule also provides an expiry date and a reason for the whitelist entry to exist.
#
# An example check section, with a single rule:
#BasePathsMissingFromPublishingApi:
#  rules:
#    - predicate:
#      - index: 'service-manual'
#        format: 'manual_section'
#      - base_path: '/this-page-in-particular-needs-ignoring-as-well'
#      expiry: '2016-05-22'
#      reason: "service-manual (and one extra page) is not fully baked yet, but we'll be ready to handle it soon"
