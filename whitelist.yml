# Whitelist file to filter out some of the differences detected by the checks.
# Each check has its own section, keyed by the check name.
# Each section can have multiple rules.
# Each rule defines a predicate in disjunctive normal form where the innermost
#   conditions are simple equality checks on particular values for fields in the check output.
# Each rule also provides an expiry date and a reason for the whitelist entry to exist.

        Business Support pages have always been kept out of the search

        business support finder (https://www.gov.uk/business-finance-support-finder)

        Completed transactions don't provide value to the user, so we don't index
        these as well.
