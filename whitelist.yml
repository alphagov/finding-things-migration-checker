# Whitelist file to filter out some of the differences detected by the checks.
# Each check has its own section, keyed by the check name.
# Each section can have multiple rules.
# Each rule defines a predicate in disjunctive normal form where the innermost
#   conditions are simple equality checks on particular values for fields in the check output.
# Each rule also provides an expiry date and a reason for the whitelist entry to exist.
#
# An example check section, with a single rule:
